Career History
======
* Visiting PhD Student, Honda Research Institute Europe GmbH, Offenbach am Main, Germany (June 2025 – Present)
  * Enhancing CoPAL with Explainable Multimodal Summaries: Extending the CoPAL (Corrective Planning of Robot Actions with Large Language Models) framework to generate natural language explanations for robotic decision-making. The project integrates Grounded-SAM-2 for visual processing, hierarchical summarization algorithms, and Qwen 3 LLM to transform complex robotic decisions into clear, human-readable explanations. This research addresses the critical challenge of robot transparency, enabling better human-robot collaboration by making AI decision-making processes interpretable and trustworthy.

* Schneider Electric, Eybens, France, Internship, MSc in Mechanical and Electrical Engineering (June 2021 - August 2021)
  * Analysed the productivity of different assembly lines for robotics applications in a factory in Riga (Latvia), targeting labour productivity and increasing the capacity of the production cell
  * Led the study of collaborative robot implementation in production lines. The leading team was delighted and decided to continue the study
  * Consulted the team by introducing other industrialisation options such as the creation of a neighbouring cell or the implementation of industrial robots instead of cobots, resulting in a human-robot collaboration
  * Proposed a new production cell configuration with possible incorporation by the manager. Studying the different scenarios taking into account the technical, logistics, ergonomics safety and cost drivers

* Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand, Workshop, MSc in Mechanical and Electrical Engineering (January 2020 - February 2020)
  * Took part in the robot building from scratch using materials at disposal such as wood, syringes or plastics. The first robot was remotely controlled to lift the second one
  * Collaborated on three Arduino programs: one to manage the servo-motors, another to lift objects and the last one to grab the targets

Research Focus
======
My research focuses on developing deep learning architectures that address the challenge of processing and understanding multimedia data—images, videos, texts, and audio. The project aims to bridge the gap between multimedia representation and machine perception of entities, their semantic meanings, and interconnected events.

Key objectives include:
* Developing architectures that link visual entities in images and textual descriptions to knowledge databases
* Enabling semantic descriptions through ontology
* Enhancing a robot\'s ability to interpret and communicate its understanding of the environment
* Improving multimedia data processing and semantic understanding for better human-robot interactions

Skills
======
* Languages: French (Native), English (Proficient – IELTS 7.5), Spanish (Intermediate), Italian (Intermediate)
* Engineering Skills: C++, Python, Matlab, GitHub, ROS & ROS2, ABB Robot Studio, HuggingFace, Ollama
* Interests: Basketball, Football, Psychoanalysis, Chess, Geopolitics

Volunteering
======
* Les Ateliers IKONA - Lyon (October 2020 - June 2021) - Event organisation and participant support
