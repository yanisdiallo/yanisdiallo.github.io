            <p class="project-description">
                My research focuses on developing deep learning architectures that address the challenge of 
                processing and understanding multimedia data—images, videos, texts, and audio. The project 
                aims to bridge the gap between multimedia representation and machine perception of entities, 
                their semantic meanings, and interconnected events.

            <p class="project-description">
                My Master's thesis focused on developing a hybrid navigation framework for autonomous mobile robots to improve obstacle avoidance in complex and changing environments. The system integrated YOLOv7 object recognition, DWA (Dynamic-Window Approach) local planning, and RRT (Rapidly exploring Random Tree) global planning. The research demonstrated enhanced navigation capabilities in the presence of both static and dynamic obstacles, effectively maneuvering through shorter distances while excelling in terms of completion time and collision avoidance.
