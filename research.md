            <p class="project-description">
                My research focuses on developing deep learning architectures that address the challenge of 
                processing and understanding multimedia data—images, videos, texts, and audio. The project 
                aims to bridge the gap between multimedia representation and machine perception of entities, 
                their semantic meanings, and interconnected events.
