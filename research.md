            Research Focus
        </h2>
        <p>My research focuses on developing deep learning architectures that address the challenge of processing and understanding multimedia dataâ€”images, videos, texts, and audio. The project aims to bridge the gap between multimedia representation and machine perception of entities, their semantic meanings, and interconnected events.</p>
        <p>Key objectives include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Developing architectures that link visual entities in images and textual descriptions to knowledge databases</li>
            <li>Enabling semantic descriptions through ontology</li>
            <li>Enhancing a robot\'s ability to interpret and communicate its understanding of the environment</li>
            <li>Improving multimedia data processing and semantic understanding for better human-robot interactions</li>
        </ul>

            <h3>Deep Learning-Based Architectures for Semantics Discovery of Entities and Events</h3>
            <p>This project, part of the TRAIL Doctoral Network, explores novel deep learning models to extract and understand semantic information from diverse multimedia sources. The goal is to create systems that can not only identify objects and actions but also comprehend their relationships and the broader context of events, crucial for advanced AI applications and human-robot collaboration.</p>

            <h3>Optimized Obstacle Avoidance using a Hybrid Navigation Framework with YOLOv7</h3>
            <p>My Master\'s thesis at Cranfield University focused on developing an efficient and robust obstacle avoidance system for mobile robots. This involved integrating real-time object detection using YOLOv7 with a hybrid navigation framework, significantly improving the robot\'s ability to navigate complex and dynamic environments.</p>
