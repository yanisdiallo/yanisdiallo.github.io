# Research Project Overview

## Project Title
Deep Learning-Based Architectures for Semantics Discovery of Entities and Events

## Funding
HORIZON-MSCA-2021-DN-01-01, project n. 101072488

## Project Description

This research project addresses the challenge of processing and understanding multimedia dataâ€”images, videos, texts, and audio. The complexity arises from the gap between multimedia representation and machine perception of entities, their semantic meanings, and interconnected events.

## Objectives

The objective is to develop deep learning architectures that link visual entities in images and textual descriptions (derived from audio) to knowledge databases, enabling semantic descriptions through ontology. By semantically integrating and describing entities and events across various data formats, this project aims to enhance a robot's ability to interpret and communicate its understanding of the environment.

## Expected Outcomes

Advancements in this field will improve:
- Multimedia data processing
- Semantic understanding
- Human-robot interactions
- Automated multimedia analysis

## Research Areas

This project intersects several key research domains:
- Deep Learning
- Computer Vision
- Natural Language Processing
- Knowledge Representation
- Robotics
- Semantic Web Technologies

## Supervision

- **Supervisor**: Alessandro Sperduti
- **Co-supervisor**: A. Paoli
