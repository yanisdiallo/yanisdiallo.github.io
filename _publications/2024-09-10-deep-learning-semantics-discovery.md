## Abstract

This presentation introduces my research on developing deep learning architectures that address the challenge of processing and understanding multimedia data—images, videos, texts, and audio. The project aims to bridge the gap between multimedia representation and machine perception of entities, their semantic meanings, and interconnected events.

The objective is to develop architectures that link visual entities in images and textual descriptions (derived from audio) to knowledge databases, enabling semantic descriptions through ontology. By semantically integrating and describing entities and events across various data formats, this project aims to enhance a robot's ability to interpret and communicate its understanding of the environment.

Advancements in this field will improve multimedia data processing and semantic understanding, facilitating better human-robot interactions and automated multimedia analysis.
